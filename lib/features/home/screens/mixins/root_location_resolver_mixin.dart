/// A mixin that handles location resolution for the root/home screen of the app.
///
/// This mixin provides automatic location detection and permission handling
/// for screens that need to know the user's current location. It manages:
/// - Location permission requests
/// - Location service status monitoring
/// - Location fetching with fallback to default location
/// - Dialog presentation for permission/service issues
/// - Lifecycle-aware location updates
///
/// The mixin automatically cancels location operations when the widget
/// is disposed and handles app lifecycle changes appropriately.
///
/// REQUIRES:
/// - A widget that extends `StatefulWidget`
/// - A `State` class that extends `State<T>` where `T` is the widget type
/// - The `State` class must implement `WidgetsBindingObserver`
///
/// Usage:
/// ```dart
/// class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
///   @override
///   State<HomeScreen> createState() => _HomeScreenState();
/// }
///
/// class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> with RootLocationResolverMixin<HomeScreen> {
///   // The mixin will automatically handle location resolution
/// }
/// ```

  /// Set to false when location is successfully obtained or when user denies permission.

  /// Prevents multiple dialogs from appearing simultaneously.

  /// Used to re-trigger location fetching when service becomes available.
